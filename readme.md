# Nanny

## Description

The purpose of this challenge is to give a general idea of how React works and how you can use it to create simple reactive applications. You’ll be implementing a simplified version of Hapu’s ‘Become a Nanny Share Host’ view.

The concepts that gonna apply are:
- [x] JSX
- [x] Components, props and state
- [x] Lifecycle Methods
- [x] Responsive design with CSS media-queries
- [x] API calls
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Loading states
- [x] SEO & accessibility
- [x] A/B tests
- [x] Production builds.

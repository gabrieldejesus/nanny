### Description

The purpose of this challenge is to give a general idea of how React works and how you can use it to create simple reactive applications. Youâ€™ll be implementing a simplified version of Hapuâ€™s â€˜Become a Nanny Share Hostâ€™ view.

The concepts that gonna apply are:
- [x] JSX
- [x] Components, props and state
- [x] Lifecycle Methods
- [x] Responsive design with CSS media-queries
- [x] API calls
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Loading states
- [x] SEO & accessibility
- [x] A/B tests
- [x] Production builds.

### ðŸ›  Getting started

Clone this repository and follow the steps below:

1. `cd nanny`
2. `yarn or npm install`
3. `cp .env.local.example .env.local`
4. Add all environment variables (**Ask me** [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieldejesuss)).
5. `yarn dev`

### ðŸš€ Contribution

1. Make the _fork_ of the project (<https://github.com/gabrieldejesus/nanny/fork>)
2. Create a _branch_ for your modification (`git checkout -b my-new-resource`)
3. Do _commit_ (`git commit -am 'Adding a new resource ...'`)
4. _Push_ (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
